# ![Hello](/icons/icons8-waving-35.png) Hello there!

My name is Cat and I am a developer for GoodGames. We create games that ignite imagination, thinking creatively, and help focus wandering minds fatigued by traditional online conferences. To learn more, click [here](https://gg.goodfocus.net/)!

👀  I’m interested in development (obviously lol), video games, photography, and animals. I have two wonderful dogs who are my whole world.
